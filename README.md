Tic-Tac-Toe with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is an iteration based on the initial React's [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). With the mind to learn React, I followed through the tutorial and further reiterate the project with additional features and responsive design.

This project will be used for experimental and learning purposes. Feel free to let me know if you have some cool idea on features, knowledges on best practices, or any improvement that you think can apply to the project.
